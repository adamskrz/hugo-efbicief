The only way to stay truly secure is to establish trust with **everything** you interact digitally. Sure, you can sign every email with GPG, inspect every packet coming in or out of your network, or refuse to use anything based in silicon valley, but the sad truth is that zero days can come from nowhere, every USB device can be malicious, anyone holding your data can be exploited, and once day you're going to have to email the council about a missing recycling bin and Mildred at reception will have absolutely no interest in communicating with you in a cryptographically signed fashion. Unfortunately, covering everything you interact with is impractical at best. 
Having said that, there are some basic things you can do to keep yourself that little bit safer, as well as keep your interactions more private. Here are some (slightly paranoid) suggestions:
- **Use open source software.** The more people looking at the source code, the less likely a stupid security flaw is going to make it into your software.
- **Vary your passwords.** It should go without saying, but using the same password for everything is bad.

something something anonymity where possible, https everywhere, privacy badger / block fingerprinting, remove tracking urls (clearurls), block ads(they track, personalised ads are not good for you), If you don't trust google, don't use google, seperate your online and real persona, think before typing your personal info anywhere, check your oss, maybe use relatively obscure software which doesn't have prebuilt scriptkiddy hacker packages for it, security through obfuscation is the best way to stay undetectable* online.
