# Why?
To understand how a system should be organised.
- Conceptual Integrity
- Quality driven eg. fault tolerance, maintainability, backwards compatability
- Recurring architecture styles
- Separation of concerns to reduce complexity

# System overview
Represented with box/arrow diagrams. Arrows show direction of data/control flow, can also show breakdown of larger subsystems.

# Layered structure
Each layer relies on the one below only, and provides services to the one above only.

# Repository structure
All subsystem interaction done via repository.

# Pipe & Filter structure
Linear data pathways formed, components process & filter the data to correct outputs.

# Modev-view-controller (MVC) structure
Focuses on interpreting user actions (controller -> model), updating the data (model), and presenting it to the user (view).
